Some issues have been found.

1. Miss-classified data
It seems that some data was assigned class label. This has been verified by looking at the wind values for each class.
For illustration, refer to figs/Figure_6.png. In particular, the wrong files are:

- The ‘1’ at 60 kts for class 3: Corresponds to date “1985y-09m-08d : 06h”, which you can find in the file 198515.tsv (last line)
- The ‘1’ at 60 kts for class 5: Corresponds to date “2006y-09m-17d : 18h”, which you can find in the file 200613.tsv (line 211)

2. Some images have irregular pixel values.
To find out, I needed to do heavy analysis. To this end I used script gh5_mean_std_max_min_scalar.py to obtain these
parameters for each image. Then, I looked at irregular behaviors. For instance, some images seemed to have way to high
mean values, or max values and so on.
Files are listed below:

199608-34
199607-58
199606-221
