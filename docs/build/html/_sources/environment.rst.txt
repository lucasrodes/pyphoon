Development environment
=======================

Currently, we only assure that **pyphoon** library will work with the
environment presented in this page. Hence, make sure to follow all the steps
provided here.


Download library
----------------


First of all, create a directory for your projects. This is where we will
place all the projects, including the **pyphoon** files.

.. code-block:: bash

   mkdir ~/projects

Next, clone the repository and place it in the ``projects`` folder

.. code-block:: bash

   cd ~/projects
   git clone https://github.com/lucasrodes/pyphoon.git



.. _deepo: https://github.com/ufoym/deepo

Docker Setup
------------

For this project a docker container has been used. In particular, we
used a
modified version of the docker `deepo`_, which provides a version with GPU
support to most DL/ML frameworks.

If you are unfamiliar with docker you can check the following tutorials:

- `Learn Docker in 12 Minutes üê≥ <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YFl2mCHdv24>`_
- `A Quick Introduction to Docker <https://blog.scottlowe.org/2014/03/11/a-quick-introduction-to-docker/>`_

But, basically, what you need to know is that a Docker container is a Virtual
Machine. It is built a Docker image, which you can either create on your own
or download. You can find tons of Docker images at the official Docker
repository, `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`_. A Docker container is
fresh and new every time you run it.

Installation with GPU support
*****************************

First, make sure you have installed the `NVIDIA driver <https://github
.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions#how-do-i-install
-the-nvidia-driver>`_.
Next, we need to install `docker <https://docs.docker
.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/>`_ and
`nvidia-docker <https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker>`_. Note that by
solely installing ``nvidia-docker`` we automatically install the
last stable release of docker-ce. Hence, all we need to do is install
nvidia-docker.


CentOS/RHEL 7 x86_64
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure to remove any previous nvidia-docker installations. If you don't
have any, the following code will just raise a not-found error.

..  code-block:: bash

    # If you have nvidia-docker 1.0 installed: we need to remove it and all existing GPU containers
    docker volume ls -q -f driver=nvidia-docker | xargs -r -I{} -n1 docker ps -q -a -f volume={} | xargs -r docker rm -f
    sudo yum remove nvidia-docker

Next, let installation begin.

..  code-block:: bash

    # Add the package repositories
    curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/centos7/x86_64/nvidia-docker.repo | \
      sudo tee /etc/yum.repos.d/nvidia-docker.repo

    # Install nvidia-docker2 and reload the Docker daemon configuration
    sudo yum install -y nvidia-docker2
    sudo pkill -SIGHUP dockerd

    # Test nvidia-smi with the latest official CUDA image
    docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi

Xenial x86_64
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure to remove any previous nvidia-docker installations. If you don't
have any, the following code will just raise a not-found error.

..  code-block:: bash

    # If you have nvidia-docker 1.0 installed: we need to remove it and all existing GPU containers
    docker volume ls -q -f driver=nvidia-docker | xargs -r -I{} -n1 docker ps -q -a -f volume={} | xargs -r docker rm -f
    sudo apt-get purge -y nvidia-docker

Next, let installation begin.

..  code-block:: bash

    # Add the package repositories
    curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | \
      sudo apt-key add -
    curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/ubuntu16.04/amd64/nvidia-docker.list | \
      sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list
    sudo apt-get update

    # Install nvidia-docker2 and reload the Docker daemon configuration
    sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2
    sudo pkill -SIGHUP dockerd

    # Test nvidia-smi with the latest official CUDA image
    docker run --runtime=nvidia --rm nvidia/cuda nvidia-smi


Installation without GPU support
********************************

We will be installing docker from the repository for CentOS. For more details
check their `website <https://docs.docker
.com/install/linux/docker-ce/centos/#install-using-the-repository>`_. Make
sure to uninstall other docker versions.

Next, let installation begin.

..  code-block:: bash

Pull Docker image
*****************
Pull the project's docker image from the docker hub:

.. code-block:: bash

   docker pull lucasrodesg/deepo

Creating an instance of the Docker image
****************************************

Creating an instance of a Docker image is very simple. The code below is for a
GPU-ready environment, to use it for non-GPU environment simply replace
``nvidia-docker`` by ``docker``.

Let us create a simple container with name "dlnii" using the command ``run``:


..  code-block:: bash

    nvidia-docker run -it --name dlnii lucasrodesg/deepo bash

However, we want our container to have some features:

*   **Port forwarding:** We might want to run some services from within your
    container (e.g. jupyter, tensorboard etc.). Hence, we will make sure some
    ports are available from outside the container by using port-forwarding.
    This is done by using the option ``-p`` when creating the Docker instance.
*   **File access:** By default, a Docker container is completely isolated from
    the outside system. However, Docker provides option ``-v`` to enable access
    from container to files in the host machine. This is particularly necessary
    in our case since the scripts running in the Docker container need to
    access the dataset files. It works as ``-v <host files path>:<accessible
    from this path in container>``.

All in all, we create our docker instance using:

..  code-block:: bash

    nvidia-docker run -it \
    -p <host port>:<container port> \
    -v ~/projects:/root/projects \
    -v /path/to/the/data/:/path/to/data/in/docker/ \
    -v /host/config:/config \
    --name dlnii lucasrodesg/deepo  bash


Let us explain below the different folders made accessible above with option
``-v``:

-   ``/path/to/the/data/``: Folder containing data needed in our project.
    Also, we will probably be storing newly generated data in this directory.
-   ``~/projects:/root/projects``: The folder containing all the projects
    needs to be accessible from inside the Docker, since we will basically be
    developing code there.

Start Docker instance
*********************

You can simply start the docker container as

..  code-block:: bash

    docker start dlnii


Once started, to execute the instance just type

..  code-block:: bash

    docker exec -it dlnii bash


To exit the container just type

..  code-block:: bash

    exit

Other Docker commands
*********************

To visualize which docker containers are currently running use

..  code-block:: bash

    docker ps -a

This should give you a list of the docker containers with their
respective names, which image they are using, ports etc.

To remove the container

..  code-block:: bash

    docker rm <container name>

Make sure that the container is not running. If that is the case, stop
it using

..  code-block:: bash

    docker stop <container name>
