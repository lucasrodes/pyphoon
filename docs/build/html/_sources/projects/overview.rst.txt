Overview
========

In this section we present all the projects developed using the pyphoon
library.

Adding documentation from new projects
--------------------------------------
If you develop a project based on this library, please feel free to make a
pull request on `Github <http://github.com/lucasrodes/pyphoon>`_ with your
documentation as a `.rst` file. Make sure to provide the author names, a
guideline to generate the dataset specific to your task and which other
libraries you used. You may find inspiration in other project's
documentation (TODO). Once the pull request is reviewed and accepted, we will
update the project documentation to incorporate your project.
