Building the Dataset
====

In this project, we use *Digital Typhoon* data for different tasks. Below we
describe how we build the respective datasets for each task.


1. Tropical Cyclone vs. Extra-Tropical Cyclone
------

Typhoons are categorised in 5 different categories. On the one hand,
categories 2, 3, 4 and 5 refer to different intensity levels of Typhoons
(Tropical Cyclones). On the other hand, category 6 stands for another natural
phenomenon known as *Extra-Tropical Cyclone*. Details on the diferences
between both phenomena can be found `here <http://www.aoml.noaa
.gov/hrd/tcfaq/A7.html>`_ and `here <http://www.hko.gov
.hk/education/edu01met/01met_tropical_cyclones/ele_typhoon3_e.htm>`_.

*   **Generating the dataset**

    For this task, we label tropical cyclones as 0 and extra-tropical
    cyclones as 1. We note that from the original dataset, only 12% of the
    data is extra-topical. Hence, using all the dataset would lead to a high
    imbalance in the class category. To overcome this, we consider all
    extra-TC samples but only a subset of TC samples, so as to have a 50/50
    dataset.

    The following script builds the dataset, assuming the typhoon sequences are
    located at ``../data/sequences/corrected_1/`` it places the newly generated
    dataset at ``../data/datasets/task_1/original_512``


    .. literalinclude:: ../../scripts/build_dataset_1.py
        :linenos:
        :language: python

    .. note::
        `script <https://github
        .com/lucasrodes/pyphoon/tree/master/scripts/build_dataset_1.py>`_

*   **Scaling dataset**

    To reduce the computational complexity of this task, we scale the images
    from 512x512 to 256x256. As input it uses the files stored at ``.
    ./data/datasets/task_1/original_512`` and places the new scaled versions
    at ``../data/datasets/task_1/original_256``

    .. literalinclude:: ../../scripts/scale_256.py
        :linenos:
        :language: python

    .. note::
        `script <https://github
        .com/lucasrodes/pyphoon/tree/master/scripts/scale_256.py>`_


*   **Normalizing dataset**
