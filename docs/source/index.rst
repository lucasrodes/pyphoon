pyphoon
===================================

pyphoon is a python tool developed in 2018 by interns at Kitamoto Lab to
support simple and easy interaction with *Digital Typhoon* dataset. It began
as a set of tools meant to assist in the exploration of the data and possible
detection of corrupted files. However, new features, such as actual models
might be added as time passes.
