You just found pyphoon
----------------------

`pyphoon`_ is a python library developed since 2017 by interns at `Kitamoto Lab`_
to provide a simple, easy and, more importantly, pythonic interaction with
the `Digital Typhoon`_ dataset. It contains a wide set of tools to assist in
the exploration and management of the building components of the dataset.
More details on the `GitHub repository`_.

What is Digital Typhoon?
------------------------

The `Digital Typhoon`_ project is an open project started by `Prof. Kitamoto`_,
which integrates different typhoon data sources. It provides more than 200,000
typhoon satellite images since 1979 and typhoon best tracks since 1951.
By doing so, the Digital Typhoon project project attempts to assist the 
scientific community in its  attempts to use data-driven and data-mining 
techniques on typhoon data.

Why name pyphoon?
-----------------

Well, we think the name explains for itself. We had some doubts, either
**pyphoon** or **pythoon**, but finally went for **pyphoon**. For the record 
and in our defense, we leave this video `here`_.
